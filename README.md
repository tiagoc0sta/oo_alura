## Lessons Learned 
During the course "Python: Understanding Object Oriented," I gained a comprehensive understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm that allows me to design and structure my code more effectively. Here are the key takeaways from the course:

## 1. Classes and Objects

- Classes are the blueprints that define the structure and behavior of objects in Python.
- Objects are instances of classes, representing individual entities with unique attributes and behaviors.

## 2. Implementing Methods

- Methods are functions defined within a class, allowing us to perform actions on objects or modify their attributes.
- These methods encapsulate the logic associated with specific functionalities of the objects.

## 3. Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP principle that allows bundling data (attributes) and methods together within a class.
- It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class, promoting data integrity, and providing a clean interface for interacting with the objects.

## 4. Using Properties

- Properties enable controlled access to class attributes, giving us the ability to define custom getter and setter methods.
- This provides an elegant way to manage attributes and apply validation or computation before accessing or modifying their values.

## 5. Private and Static Methods

- Private methods are prefixed with a double underscore (e.g., "__private_method()") and are intended for internal use within the class.
- Static methods are decorated with "@staticmethod" and do not have access to class or instance-specific data, making them useful for utility functions.

## Conclusion

The course "Python: Understanding Object Oriented" has significantly improved my grasp of object-oriented programming in Python. I now feel confident in designing and implementing robust and modular code using classes and objects. The concepts of encapsulation, properties, private, and static methods have empowered me to create more organized and maintainable codebases.

With this newfound knowledge, I am excited to take on more complex projects, leverage OOP design patterns, and continue exploring advanced Python topics. Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm, and I am eager to unlock its full potential in my future coding endeavors.
